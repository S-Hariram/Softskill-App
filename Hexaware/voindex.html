                <h2>Why Vocabulary is Important</h2>
                <p>Vocabulary forms an integral part of the process of reading and readers’ comprehension. It refers to the words needed for communicating effectively. It implies receptive vocabulary and expressive vocabulary. Receptive vocabulary refers to the words that we hear and read while expressive vocabulary implies the words that we speak and write. It is rightly said that without vocabulary, it is not possible to convey anything. A broader idea of vocabulary is discussed below.</p>

                <h2>What is Vocabulary in English?</h2>
                <p>The answer to 'what is vocabulary in English?' is all the words that form a language to be understood by a specific person or maybe a group of people. Vocabulary in English can be categorized into two types, namely- active and passive. The words that we use and understand in day-to-day language are termed as active vocabulary while the ones which we know but use rarely are said to be passive vocabulary.</p>

                <h2>Three Tiers of Vocabulary</h2>
                <h3>Basic Vocabulary</h3>
                <p>The basic words form the first tier of vocabulary. These words normally have a single meaning and do not require instruction. Early reading words, sight words, adjectives, verbs, nouns, etc are portrayed in this tier. 8000-word families in English comprise this tier.</p>

                <h3>High-frequency Vocabulary</h3>
                <p>Also called the multiple meaning vocabulary tier, this tier comprises words used in a variety of domains, adult communication, literature, etc. It influences reading and speaking. 7000-word families comprise this tier.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It has multiple meanings</li>
                    <li>Vital for reading comprehension</li>
                    <li>Typical mature language</li>
                    <li>Descriptive vocabulary</li>
                    <li>A diverse environment use these words</li>
                    <li>Used for direct instruction</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Low-frequency Vocabulary</h3>
                <p>The words that are used only when specifically required or in a particular domain like weather, technology, geographical region, occupation, hobbies, school, etc. comprise this tier. About four lakh words in vocabulary in English comprise this tier.</p>

                <h2>Types of Vocabulary</h2>
                <p>The types of vocabulary can be categorized based on spoken and written vocabulary. Children start vocabulary-building through listening and speaking even before writing and reading. Every type of vocabulary has a different aim and purpose. However, the development of one type of vocabulary facilitates another.</p>

                <h3>Listening Vocabulary</h3>
                <p>Listening vocabulary comprises words that we understand through hearing. A fetus may start recognizing some words when in the womb. Learning new words is a continuous process, and by the time you reach adulthood, almost fifty thousand words are understood and recognized by you. Deaf people can be exposed to visual listening vocabulary for learning.</p>

                <h3>Speaking Vocabulary</h3>
                <p>Speaking vocabulary consists of words that we actually speak. It has a horizon of around 5000 to 10000 words. These are used for giving instructions and conversations. The number of words in this category are comparatively lesser than the listening vocabulary.</p>

                <h3>Reading Vocabulary</h3>
                <p>The major ingredient of vocabulary building is reading. Reading grows and develops your vocabulary. The words we get to learn while reading a text are termed as reading vocabulary. It may happen that we understand words through reading vocabulary even if we don’t use it in speaking vocabulary.</p>

                <h3>Writing Vocabulary</h3>
                <p>Words we recoup while expressing ourselves through writing are termed as writing vocabulary. Writing vocabulary is normally influenced by the words we are able to spell. We find it easy to express verbally, through facial expression, or intonation, but writing vocabulary depends upon our expertise in vocabulary.</p>

                <h3>Final Vocabulary</h3>
                <p>Richard Rorty discovered this term ‘Final Vocabulary’. It is a collection, set, or group of words that every person applies to justify their actions, beliefs, and lives. Final vocabulary comprises words a person avails to praise, contempt, express deep feelings, hopes, doubts, etc.</p>
